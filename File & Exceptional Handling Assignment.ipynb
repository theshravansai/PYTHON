    "\n",
    "##### Multithreading is preferable when:\n",
    "1. Tasks are I/O bound (waiting for file, network, or user input).\n",
    "2. Tasks share common memory and data structures.\n",
    "3. Lightweight concurrency is required (threads are cheaper than processes).\n",
    "4. Example: Web scraping, real-time chat servers, file reading/writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Multiprocessing is preferable when:\n",
    "1. Tasks are CPU bound (require heavy computation).\n",
    "2. Each task needs to run independently (separate memory space).\n",
    "3. You want to fully utilize multi-core CPUs.\n",
    "4. Example: Matrix multiplication, image processing, data analysis.\n",
